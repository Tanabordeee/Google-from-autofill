# Automated Form Submission using Selenium
This Python script utilizes the Selenium library to automate the process of filling out a web form. The script prompts the user for relevant information such as the target website link, the number of elements in the form, and details about each form element (text boxes, buttons, and radio elements). It then performs the specified actions in a loop.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Python: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   Selenium: `pip install selenium`
-   ChromeDriver: Download the appropriate version from [https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.


## How to Use

1.  Run the script.
2.  Enter the target website link when prompted.
3.  Input the number of elements in the form.
4.  For each form element, specify whether it is a textbox or a button/radio element.
5.  Provide the XPath for each element as requested.
6.  If the element is a textbox, enter the desired input.
7.  If the element is a button or radio element, simply provide the XPath.
8.  Enter the number of times you want to submit the form (loop count).
